# **Secure Software-Defined Networking with Blockchain-Based Trust and Routing Verification**

## **Abstract**

The increasing complexity of modern networks demands advanced security and resilience mechanisms. This project proposes a novel integration of **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain** to enhance security, optimize routing, and mitigate attacks. i leverage a **permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)** to establish a **Proof of Authority (PoA)** scheme for authenticating network devices and controllers. Additionally, **Proof of Work (PoW)** is introduced to verify routing modifications and other network state modification before implementation, ensuring network stability and security. Smart contracts deployed on the blockchain automate network security responses, including **dynamic rerouting, attack mitigation, and certificate revocation**. This repository provides an implementation framework, algorithms, and a simulation model for evaluating the proposed approach.

## **Methodology**

my approach integrates multiple technologies and security paradigms to achieve a **self-defending network**:

### **1. Network Model & Routing Optimization**
- The network is represented as a **weighted graph** where nodes (routers, switches, firewalls, endpoints) are vertices, and links between them are edges.
- Routing follows **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**, optimized for both **latency** and **security constraints**.
- A **congestion-aware queuing model (M/M/1 Queue)** ensures real-time traffic adjustments.

### **2. Blockchain for Trust & Verification**
- A **Hyperledger Fabric blockchain** is used to establish a **decentralized trust model**.
- **PoA (Proof of Authority)** authenticates network devices using **certificates signed by a root CA**.
- **PoW (Proof of Work)** ensures that proposed routing changes undergo **verification** before deployment.

### **3. Smart Contract-Driven Network Security**
- The SDN controller listens for security events and triggers **smart contracts**.
- Actions include:
  - **Removing compromised edge devices**
  - **Changing routing paths based on attack type**
  - **Revoking endpoint certificates if compromised**
  - **Blocking attacker IPs dynamically**
- These actions are validated by **PoW nodes before execution**, preventing malicious or faulty updates.

## **Proposed Architecture**

The architecture consists of three primary components:

1. **SDN Layer** (OpenFlow-based Controllers & Data Planes)
2. **Blockchain Layer** (Hyperledger Fabric, PoA Authentication, PoW Verification)
3. **Security Enforcement Layer** (Smart Contracts for Attack Response)

Each component interacts through **secure APIs**, ensuring a robust and adaptable network security model.

## **Next Steps**
- Implement a **simulation model** to validate attack response efficiency.
- Define and test **mathematical models** (game theory, queuing, graph algorithms).
- Develop an **open-source framework** for integrating blockchain with SDN controllers.
- Optimize **PoW verification algorithms** to minimize computational overhead.
